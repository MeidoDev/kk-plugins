NoVampire
===

An experimental mod I used to learn how2Bepis and how2Harmony. The mod was supposed to prevent the game from hiding the player character once you switch to first person view, making him invisble in mirrors (hence the "no vampire").

 Due to some Unity internals, the way the game toggles the visibility or whatever thing I don't understand yet, the mod actually only works for a split-second work. Then the player character goes poof again.

 Even so, since the main purpose of this plugin was learning how to write them - and I did learn a few things - I'll chalk this up as success. Even though the plugin doesn't work. Yup.
